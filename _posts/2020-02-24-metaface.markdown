We propose a novel face recognition method via meta-learning named Meta Face Recognition (MFR) to learn a generalized model performing well on unseen domains. Besides, we propose two benchmarks for generalized face recognition evaluation. The proposed benchmarks will be available at <a href="https://github.com/cleardusk/MFR">https://github.com/cleardusk/MFR</a>.
