<!-- Micro emotion recognition is a very challenging problem because of the subtle appearance variants among different facial expression classes. To deal with the mentioned problem, we proposed a multi-modality convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on visual and geometrical information in this paper. In the final testing phase of Micro Emotion Challenge, our method has got the first place with the misclassiﬁcation of 80.212137. -->
